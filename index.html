                                                                                 <li> The history of the <em>Cocker Spaniel</em> can be traced back to 14th Century Spain</li>
                                                                         <li> The term <em>'Spaniel'</em> is said to come from the French word for <em>'Spanish'</em> which is <em>'Espagnol'</em></li>
<li> Prior to the 1800's; Cocker and Springer Spaniels were catigorised together and simply called a Land Spaniel</li>
<li>They were developed to have different jobs, based on their size, with the larger ones being used to spring out game and the smaller ones being used to spring out woodcock</li>
<li>The differences between the two became more pronouced due to selective breeding and by 1893 they were recognised as two separate breeds by <em>The Kennel Club</em> </li>      
                                                                          <li>In the early twentieth century; they became popular as family pets and for showing, which led to the belief that they were useless as working dogs. Today, however, they have experienced a resurguence as a hunting and working dog.</li>                           
<li> The Working Cocker Spaniel's natural instinict to 'work' means they are intelligent, loyal and willing to learn. They respond well to obedience training and positive reinforcement. </li>
<li> They are kind, gentle and loving dogs and, for that reason, make great family pets</li>                                                   <li> Famous Cocker Spaniels include <em>'Lady'</em>, from 'Lady and the Tramp', and <em>'Lupo' </em>, the late family pet of the <em>Duke and Duchess of Cambridge </em></li> </ul>                         
                                                                                                                          
                                                                         <blockquote> <em> "Over the years i have felt the truest, purest love - the love of God really, I imagine thats what Gods love feels like - is the love that come from your dog" </em> <strong>"Oprah Winfrey" </strong> </blockquote>
